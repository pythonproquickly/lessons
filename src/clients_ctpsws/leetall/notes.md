Apologies in advance for the length of the message. I want to be as detailed as
possible.
I am a masters student (environmental studies) doing thesis research on skin
cancer proteins/biomarkers and green chemistry for protein separation. Due to
delays in my research, I have been asked to take on another task...data
analysis. I have zero background in computer science of any kind (all of this is
brand new to me), so my lab team mentor for data analysis has sent me three
coursera courses to audit as a starting point:
Course 1: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course#syllabus
Course 2:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-thinking-problem-solving#syllabus
Course 3:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-k-means-clustering-python#syllabus
At the moment, I have finished the videos of the python crash course (first
link) and while they make sense as I watch, I have been having some difficulties
solving quiz problems. I am stuck on object-orienting programming quiz problems.
This is where I would like to start. I am looking for guidance as I work through
these. 
In the second course, I have been presented with some flow charts. I would also
like to spend time on working towards turning these into python code. 
The bigger picture goal:
There is previously collected protein data. Half the data was analyzed by a
student no longer on the team. Ideally, I will analyze the remaining data. The
code written by the previous student is not necessarily transferable (according
to my data science mentor...we only meet twice a month which is part of the
reason why I am seeking external help). I need to be able to understand how to
work with the python language in the field of bioinformatics. There is a lot
here that is still unknown to me, but I hope to gain some clarity in a meeting
with my mentor tonight.
