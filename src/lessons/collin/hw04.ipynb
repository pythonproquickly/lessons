    "\n",
    "The **winning numbers** are chosen by King Triton drawing five balls, one at a time, **without replacement**, from a pot of white balls numbered 1 to 62. Then, he draws a gold ball, the Tritonball, from a pot of gold balls numbered 1 to 16. Both pots are completely separate, hence the different ball colors. For example, maybe the winning numbers are (13, 15, 62, 3, 5, 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôll assume for this problem that in order to win the grand prize (free housing), all six of your numbers need to match the winning numbers and be in the **exact same positions**. In other words, your entire sequence of numbers must be exactly the same as the sequence of winning numbers. However, if some numbers in your sequence match up with the corresponding number in the winning sequence, you will still win some Triton Cash. \n",
