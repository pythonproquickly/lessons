# You are a python developer working for a building architect.
# For every building the architect designs it is always a
# challenge to estimate the correct number of elevators needed for
# the building.
# Your job is to build a simulation that will be used to develop
# a robust elevator estimating algorithm.
# The simulation will be used for exploratory testing to identify
# the data requirements that are needed to get the number of
# elevators right.
# When confident in the simulation, you will build the elevator
# estimation program.
