Hello Andy! I am attaching a zip file with my programming assignment and codes.  The one I am currently on is week 8, but you will notice that I have also included weeks 6-7, because the week 8 code is building off of my weeks 6-7 assignment.  the most updated code I am working on in the zip file is autompg3.py and I seem to be getting confused with when running it giving me the error for command, and not fully grasping from week 7 if the command line is running accurately.  I am waiting for an update on my week 7 grade which I should have some feedback on tomorrow but definitely before our meeting on Sunday.  But, I worked on it for hours and am still very confused on my progress towards week 8 or if my code is really running accurately for week 7, which really needs to be working first since week 8 builds off of week 7 assuming that the week 7 code is working, thus I have included my progress throughout these weeks in the attached zip folder.  I am sure I will have additional questions too as I continue to work on this over the weekend in the limited time I do have, and receive some feedback as well! Thanks in advanced for any help and feedback!
