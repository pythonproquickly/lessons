So the shell script needs to
1. Import all the GitHub repos within the organization.
2. List all the git repos.
3. Parse out or somehow filter out a list of repos.
4. Take the new list and search through each repo for a particular file (.whitesource) and delete that file from all repos.
5. Commit and push

So for the first step I need to
#list all repos in coligo `gh repo list coligo` Showing 297 of 297 repositories in @coligo: Then take a new list that has files that I dont want to make any changes too. Use that to parse out of the 297.... now I have the remaining files that I want to delete a particular file.

gh repo list [<owner>] [flags]
find /path/to/file/ | grep car | xargs ls -lh
find /path/to/file/ | grep car | xargs rm -fr
