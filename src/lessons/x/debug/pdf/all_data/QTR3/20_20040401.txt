general organization is a gpe corporation founded in 1964 . we are engaged in one principal business segment which is material handling equipment and system and our operation are conducted largely through subsidiary company . we have manufacturing facility in the gpe gpe the organization and gpe and our equipment is sold and supported throughout the world . on january 2 2003 we purchased all of the outstanding stock of gpe crusher corporation person . as result of this acquisition we now also own person which is a whollyowned subsidiary of person . we serve the bulk solid material handling market through three separate business line . these three business line or group focus primarily on feeding equipment pneumatic conveying equipment and size reduction equipment respectively . our material handling equipment is used in a wide variety of manufacturing and other industrial process particularly in the plastic food chemical detergent pharmaceutical electric utility and pulp and paper industry . we design engineer produce market and service this equipment and we sell it both on a stand alone basis and a part of a larger system that we may design and sell . replacement part are an important aspect of all of our business and they comprise a significant majority of the sale of our size reduction group . feeding equipment our feeder group which consists of several organization company operating in the gpe gpe and gpe is generally referred to a the organization . this group produce feeder that control the flow of material into a manufacturing process by weight known a gravimetric feeding or by volume known a volumetric feeding . the manufacturing process then transforms these material into an end product . our feeder are used in many different industry worldwide including the plastic compounding food chemical detergent and pharmaceutical industry . we believe that we are the global leader in the production and sale of feeder for the handling of bulk solid in a manufacturing process . organization . the feeding equipment sold by the organization is offered throughout the world under the organization brand name by approximately 60 independent sale representative organization with exclusive territory by organization sale company in gpe germany the organization and gpe and directly from the factory in other location which are not covered by either of the foregoing distribution channel . the organization market and sell both stand alone unit and engineered system where one or more feeder are combined with other complementary material handling equipment . feeders . the organization market conventional single and twin screw feeder belt feeder and vibratory feeder . we offer these feeder type in a number of different design size and finish to meet the requirement of a given material handling application and to assure compliance with applicable industry code and specification . in addition these feeder are available in both a 3 table of organization volumetric mode where the flow of material is controlled by volume and a gravimetric mode where the flow of material is controlled either by weight or loss of weight over a defined time period . gravimetric feeder which represent the majority of our feeding equipment sale are used in premium application where shortterm accuracy in feeding the raw material is essential to produce a highquality end product . the organization also recently introduced a new type of feeder which we refer to a the organization or person that is based on a patented technology which we have licensed on a worldwide exclusive basis in the field of use relevant for our feeder business . the organization feeder doe not utilize the usual screw belt or vibratory tray to convey material but instead relies upon positive displacement action to feed accurately freeflowing material offering uniform discharge consistent volume and gentle handling . it achieves this result by using vertical rotating disc that create a product lockup zone which then conveys the material smoothly from storage hopper to discharge outlet over a defined range . in addition to feeder we also produce mass flow meter which measure and control the flow of material from a storage vessel . our flow meter have no moving part and therefore require little maintenance and they do not need to be calibrated to a specific mass flow range . all of our feeding equipment model have been developed by our own internal research and development group . organization and organization . the performance of gravimetric feeder depends to a great extent on the weighing and control system being used . our proprietary weight sensor known a smart force transducers are based on a vibrating wire technology . these load cell have evolved over more than 30 year into today s rugged and driftfree weighing system . when combined with our proprietary control system known a smartconnex they constitute what we believe to be one of the most accurate system generally available for gravimetric feeding . person . the organization also market vacuum loader for the refilling of feeder and for use in other material handling application . these loader are manufactured by our pneumatic conveying group described below and the organization group sell them under the organization product name . we believe that we are the only company offering integrated feeder and vacuum loader control to the process industry . organization and training . the organization ha a global service network that enables u to respond to customer call within 24 hour almost anywhere in the world . we also sell part to our customer and our service and part business is an important source of revenue for u . in addition to equipment service and

organization pneumatic conveying equipment is sold primarily in the organization where person and organization are among the leader in their respective market and organization equipment is sold by the organization throughout the world . person competition exists in every major geographic and industrial market that we serve . competitors of our pneumatic conveying group are generally small company with a limited line of product that operate in a specific geographic area . person equipment our size reduction group which is comprised of our u.s.based person and person business design engineer manufacture market sell and service primarily size reduction equipment such a hammermills and wood hog . this equipment is used to resize various material to a given smaller size and the principal industry served are the electric utility mining pulp and paper and wood and forest product industry . while both company offer their equipment in many part of the world we believe that person is the leader in the gpe in selling size reduction equipment to the electric utility industry and that person is one of the leader in producing such equipment for the gpe pulp and paper industry . person . person manufacture size reduction and related equipment for the electric utility industry to crush coal before it is used a fuel in the steam furnace of power generation plant and it also serf other industry such a mining quarrying and glass making . person sell it equipment and service worldwide through more than 50 independent sale representative with a focus on the gpe market and with a growing presence in gpe . the crusher most commonly sold by person are hammermills in which the material is broken by impact from hammer and then scrubbed against a screen for desired size . person manufacture a number of different hammermill design such a granulators that use row of ring hammer to crush with a slow positive rolling action and organization breaker where the material is crushed by gravity impact only . crushers come in a wide variety of size and configuration and every machine is builttoorder to meet customer specification . person also manufacture and market a positive displacement action feeder using the same licensed technology that is the basis of the organization s person . person owns the exclusive right to utilize this technology in feeder of 24inch diameter and larger for market in the gpe gpe and gpe . these feeder are sold primarily to feed coal into pulverizers in coalfired power plant and they also feed limestone into raw mill in the cement industry . feeders normally account for a significant part of person s new equipment sale . person replacement parts . a significant portion of person s revenue is derived from the sale of replacement part . person ha a large installed base of longlived 6 table of organization equipment and every machine and part sold including specification and drawing is registered in a digital database to enable person to provide customer with fast and efficient support . person . person produce wood hog other size reduction equipment and related item for use primarily in the pulp and paper and wood and forest product industry . person hammermills are also sold to the mining industry to resize chunk of coal which come directly out of the mine into smaller piece . person market it crusher and other equipment through a combination of independent sale representative and distributor with a focus on the gpe market . the organization brand encompasses a number of basic crusher design that are available in varying size and configuration to meet specific customer need . person and bark hog are used in the pulp and paper and wood and forest product industry to produce mulch boiler fuel chip for composite wood product and compost . person also sell a chip sizer that is marketed to the pulp and paper industry to resize chip too large for use in a pulp digester and another crusher that is marketed to the mining industry to reduce coal chunk from the minemouth for further processing . person also sell a line of electromechanical and electromagnetic vibratory feeder that are used primarily in the aggregate coal mineral chemical and other industry to feed bulk solid material into process . applications range from reclaiming aggregate from stockpile to feeding coal in a potentially explosive environment . person . a significant portion of gpe s revenue is derived from replacement part sale . manufacturing . the manufacturing activity of both person and person consist of machining and welding raw material and casting into machined part and assembling these part together with component purchased from outside supplier into size reduction and other equipment . the equipment is then balanced and tested before being shipped to a customer s site . person part such a frame and rotor are built individually to order with no part stocked in inventory . certain higher volume part such a hammer which are also marketed a replacement part are produced to inventory or purchased in volume from outside supplier . competition . we believe that person is the leading gpe producer of hammermills and related equipment for the size reduction of steam coal that person is among the gpe market leader in resizing wood chip for pulp and paper application and that both person and person have reached these position primarily because of superior machine design and quality . person and person also rely on their reputation and many year of experience in serving the need of their customer to maintain a competitive advantage . competition exists in every market that person and person serve . competitors are generally smaller company with a limited line of product competing in specific geographic market and application . organization ktron electronics design produce and test electronic assembly for use by u and also to sell to third party generally focusing on small production run for customer in gpe eastern gpe and organization . its facility which are located in gpe new jersey provide both automated surface mount and throughhole assembly capability a well a testing equipment . 7 table of contents the regional market for electronic assembly is large and organization is one of many supplier to this market . customers we sell our equipment throughout the world to a wide variety of customer in our market ranging from large global company to regional and local business . no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in fiscal 2003 . suppliers although certain component of our product are currently purchased from sole source we believe that comparable component can be obtained from alternative supplier at price competitive with those of our current supplier . we have never experienced a significant production delay that wa primarily attributable to an outside supplier . patents our technology is protected by numerous patent in the gpe and in other major country that offer patent protection . certain of our patent have expired and others will expire at various future date . the loss of such patent protection is not expected to have a significant adverse effect on our business . research and development we invest in research and development r d to maintain a technological leadership position in our feeding and pneumatic conveying equipment business . r d in these area focus on new product a well a on improvement to existing product with particular emphasis on the application of weighing and control technology and mechanical design improvement . current effort are aimed at developing new product shortening the time spent in the development of such product modifying existing product design to provide lower cost product and analyzing the price/performance relationship for both new and existing product . we spend a minor amount on r d effort in our size reduction equipment business although we occasionally do development work in connection with a project where the cost of such work is charged to the project rather than being treated a an r d expense . our research and development expense were 2695000 2429000 and 2644000 in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively . person the end of fiscal 2003 our backlog of unfilled order wa approximately 17334000 compared to a backlog of approximately 9203000 at the end of fiscal 2002 an increase of 88.4 at constant foreign exchange rate . the backlog of order at the end of fiscal 2003 wa greater than the 2002 yearend backlog primarily due to the inclusion of person and person and a higher level of order for our feeding equipment . excluding the facility and person backlog our backlog at the end of fiscal 2003 at constant foreign exchange rate increased by 19.3 compared to the end of fiscal 2002 . 8 table of contents a majority of our 2003 yearend backlog represented order that will be ready for shipment to customer in le than 120 day from the end of fiscal 2003 . thus except for delivery to be made later in the year in accordance with customer request it is expected that much of our backlog at the end of fiscal 2003 will be shipped prior to april 30 2004 . employees at the end of fiscal 2003 we had 474 employee of which 276 were located in the gpe 178 in gpe 11 in gpe 4 in gpe 4 in gpe and 1 in gpe . none of our employee are represented by labor union . we consider relation with our employee to be good . results of gpe . introduction for a description of organization s business refer to item 1 of part i of this annual report on form 10k . as indicated in item 1 we are engaged in one principal business segment material handling equipment and system . we operate in two primary geographic location location and gpe america the organization and gpe the gpe and gpe emea/asia . we have three main business line within the material handling equipment and system segment . they are in descending order of revenue in 2003 our feeding size reduction and pneumatic conveying business line . prior to the january 2 2003 acquisition of person our feeding line whose product are sold worldwide wa the main profit contributor within our group of business . during the past three year capital equipment spending by our customer ha been depressed due to the global economic slowdown and excess manufacturing capacity built up in the late 1990s in the gpe . this ha been particularly true for the plastic and chemical industry which comprise a major share of our market for feeding equipment . management look at trend in indicator such a the organization for manufacturing published by the organization of organization management to judge the prospect for capital equipment spending . these indicator began to show improvement in the latter part of 2003 . historically improvement in our feeding equipment sale generally lag improvement in these indicator in some case by a much a six to twelve month . the majority of revenue and profit in our feeding line is generated by equipment and system sale with a lesser amount attributable to service part and repair . the organization recently installed a common worldwide person erp software system which is expected to make internal process more efficient reduce error and shorten the time from order to delivery . there also is an ongoing initiative to standardize our feeding equipment worldwide to improve overall operating efficiency and streamline service requirement . new product innovation is a major objective of our r d effort . our feeder group ha the ability to serve nearly all geographic region of the world from it two assemblyandtest facility in gpe new jersey and organization . our size reduction business line wa added with the purchase of person and person on january 2 2003 . in contrast to our feeding line person and person sell equipment primarily into gpe market with some sale into gpe and other foreign country . the main industry served are the electric utility mining pulp and paper and wood and forest product industry and a majority of revenue and profit are generated from replacement part sale instead of new equipment . both person and person maintain an extensive database of previously sold equipment including equipment drawing which enables them to respond quickly and efficiently to fill customer spare part order . our size reduction business line saw a modest decline in 2003 a a result of lower economic activity excess plant capacity and financial restructuring in the power industry . significant indicator that management us to judge prospect for this business line in gpe include the level of electricity consumption the financial health of the electric utility industry and the demand for paper and forest product . 14 table of organization our pneumatic conveying line comprises a relatively small portion of our overall revenue . this equipment is sometimes sold through the organization in conjunction with feeder equipment a a mean of transporting a dry material from one part of a plant to the inlet of a feeder and the company in the pneumatic conveying group also sell equipment and complete system in application which do not necessarily incorporate feeder . aside from selling into market common to the feeder line the pneumatic conveying group also sell into the plastic extrusion and molding market . most of the revenue and profit of this line are generated from equipment and system sale . the factor affecting the pneumatic conveying line are similar to those affecting the feeder line but also include factor which may affect the secondary plastic market generally . the following provides information that management belief is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated result of operation and financial condition . the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statement and accompanying note . all reference in this item 7 to 2003 2002 and 2001 mean the fiscal year ended january 3 2004 december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 respectively . person policies and estimates the organization prepares it financial statement in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the gpe . the preparation of such financial statement requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of those financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period . actual result could differ from those estimate . the organization discloses it significant accounting policy in the note to it audited consolidated financial statement . judgments and estimate of uncertainty are required in applying the organization s accounting policy in certain area . following are some of the area requiring significant judgment and estimate : determination of an asset s useful life estimate of allowance for bad debt cash flow and valuation assumption in performing asset impairment test of longlived asset estimate of the realizability of deferred tax asset determination of the adequacy of the reserve for inventory obsolescence and warranty cost and legal contingency . there are numerous critical assumption that may influence accounting estimate in these and other area . we base our critical assumption on historical experience thirdparty data and various other estimate we believe to be reasonable . certain of the more critical assumption include : depreciable lives of gpe and organization changes in technology person and tear changes in market demand person worthiness of specific customer and aging of customer balance contractual right and obligation general and specific economic condition 15 table of organization intended use of asset and expected future cash flow gpe specific trend and economic condition customer preference and behavior pattern impact of regulatory initiative deferred taxes expected future profitability and cash flow impact of regulatory initiative timing of reversal of existing temporary difference between book and taxable income person product introduction current product demand product life cycle change past experience person product introduction past experience person contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceeding . we have accrued our estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of these claim . this estimate ha been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matter and is based upon an analysis of potential result assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategy . we do not believe these proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position . it is possible however that future result of operation for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by change in our assumption or the effectiveness of our strategy related to these proceeding . results of organization fiscal 2003 wa a 53week year while fiscal year 2002 and 2001 were 52week year . in 2003 2002 and 2001 we reported revenue of 94676000 68231000 and 71819000 and net income of 3723000 3284000 and 1048000 respectively . the significant 2003 revenue increase from 2002 and 2001 level largely reflected the january 2 2003 acquisition of person partly offset by a decline in revenue from the other part of our business reflecting a poor global economy and continued weakness in capital equipment spending in the process industry we serve . 16 table of contents the improvement in net income in 2003 versus 2002 wa also due to the acquisition of person the effect of which wa partly offset by lower profit in the organization group a a result of the weak global economy and the reduced capital equipment spending previously mentioned . the improvement in net income in 2002 versus 2001 wa largely caused by two factor the sale of our person heavy feeder business in the third quarter of 2001 and the benefit of a lower cost structure resulting from the globalization and cost reduction initiative that we implemented in the second half of 2001 . acquisitions/divestitures on july 31 2001 we sold our person heavy feeder business to our largest distributor of gpe equipment and recorded a pretax loss of 620000 . the asset sold were primarily inventory and fixed asset . the buyer assumed the lease of the gpe sale office in gpe tel gpe and leased from u a companyowned facility in gpe . the purchase price consisted of a combination of 1000000 gpe franc cash 594000 two promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of 3017000 gpe franc 1792000 which bear interest and amortize over seven year and a le than 20 equity position in the buyer . we retained all of the gpe receivables and payable at the time of the sale a well a the owned building in gpe germany which a noted above is being leased to the buyer . the buyer ha made all required payment on the promissory note and the unpaid principal amount of such note wa 2338000 gpe franc 1887000 at the end of 2003 . on november 30 2001 we acquired person pcs . the purchase price wa 600000 gpe pound sterling 855000 which wa paid in a combination of cash 75 and note 25 and the note have now been fully paid . in december 2001 we sold our gpe machine and welding shop to an independent gpe machine shop company and recorded a pretax gain of 242000 . the purchase price consisted of a combination of 300000 gpe franc cash 182000 and a 700000 gpe franc obligation 420000 which is supported by a bank guaranty and had been reduced to 355000 gpe franc 287000 at the end of 2003 . the gpe dollar number mentioned in the foregoing three paragraph reflect relevant foreign currency exchange rate at the several date referred to . on january 2 2003 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of person . as a result of this purchase we also acquired person a whollyowned subsidiary of person . the purchase price for the facility stock wa 23500000 paid at closing a postclosing adjustment of 205000 based on facility s consolidated stockholder equity at december 31 2002 and 1288000 in the quarter ended january 3 2004 in conjunction with the organization s organization section 338h10 election relating to such acquisition . of this amount 20993000 wa paid in cash and 4000000 wa in unsecured promissory note which are payable in equal annual installment on january 2 of 2005 2006 and 2007 . with respect to the payment of the cash portion of the purchase price and related acquisition cost other than the section 338h10 election we financed 15000000 through a 17000000 secured credit facility with person a the borrower and person a the guarantor with the additional 2000000 being available for working capital and general corporate purpose subject to certain limitation and the lender ha no recourse against any other organization company with respect to any amount borrowed thereunder except by a 17 table of organization nonrecourse pledge of the stock of person . additionally we borrowed 5000000 from a gpe bank through another organization whollyowned subsidiary and used these fund to pay part of the purchase price . this obligation wa guaranteed by organization and organization also issued the 4000000 of unsecured promissory note . as noted above organization and person incurred substantial debt a a result of the facility acquisition . this debt including the amount outstanding at the end of 2003 is described in more detail in the organization and organization resources section below ; however organization and person have met all required principal and interest payment and expect their cash flow to be adequate to cover all future principal and interest payment on these borrowing . organization rates we are an international company and we derived approximately 41 58 and 58 of our 2003 2002 and 2001 revenue respectively from product manufactured in and service performed from our facility located outside the gpe primarily in gpe . since we operate globally we are sensitive to change in foreign currency exchange rate foreign exchange rate which can affect both the translation of financial statement item into gpe dollar a well a transaction where the revenue and related expense may initially be accounted for in different currency such a sale made from our gpe manufacturing facility in currency other than the gpe franc . with the acquisition of person and person we were le affected in 2003 by foreign exchange rate since most of their sale are in gpe dollar . nevertheless between 40 and 50 of our 2004 revenue will likely be from product manufactured in and service performed from our facility outside the gpe so that we will continue to have significant sensitivity to foreign exchange rate change . since we have received substantial revenue in recent year from activity in foreign jurisdiction our result can be significantly affected by change in foreign exchange rate particularly in gpe dollar exchange rate with respect to the gpe franc euro and gpe pound sterling and to a lesser degree the gpe dollar and other currency . when the gpe dollar weakens against these currency the gpe dollar value of nonu.s . dollarbased sale increase . when the gpe dollar strengthens against these currency the gpe dollar value of nonu.s . dollarbased sale decrease . correspondingly the gpe dollar value of nonu.s . dollarbased cost increase when the gpe dollar weakens and decrease when the gpe dollar strengthens . overall our revenue in gpe dollar generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currency worldwide especially those identified above . in particular a general weakening of the gpe dollar against other currency would positively affect our revenue gross profit and operating income a expressed in gpe dollar provided that the gross profit and operating income number from foreign operation are not loss since in the case of a loss the effect would be to increase the loss whereas a general strengthening of the gpe dollar against such currency would have the opposite effect . in addition our revenue and income with respect to particular transaction may be affected by change in foreign exchange rate where sale are made in currency other than the functional currency of the facility manufacturing the product subject to the sale . 18 table of organization 2003 2002 and 2001 the change in certain key exchange rate affecting the organization were a follows : presentation of gpe and analysis the following table set forth our result of operation expressed a a percentage of total revenue for the period indicated a well a our backlog : 19 table of organization revenue increased by 26445000 or 38.8 in 2003 compared to 2002 . this increase in revenue wa mainly the result of acquiring person on january 2 2003 which contributed revenue of 32086000 and the positive effect of a weaker gpe dollar on the translation of the revenue of foreign operation into gpe dollar . the increase resulting from these two factor wa partly offset by a decline in revenue in our other business a a result of a weaker global economy a reduction in spending for industrial capital equipment in the process industry we serve and the effect of the organization outbreak in gpe in the early part of 2003 . if the average foreign exchange rate for 2002 were applied to 2003 total revenue for 2003 would have increased by 21375000 or 31.3 versus the 26445000 and 38.8 on an asreported basis . total revenue decreased by 3588000 or 5.0 in 2002 compared to 2001 but increased by 1037000 or 1.5 without the organization heavy feeder business which wa sold on july 31 2001 . this increase in revenue without person wa driven by twelve full month of revenue in 2002 from the november 30 2001 acquisition of organization versus one month in 2001 and the positive effect of a weaker gpe dollar on the translation of the revenue of foreign operation into gpe dollar . such increase wa partially offset by lower revenue in gpe and the organization due to a weaker global economy and a reduction in capital equipment spending in the process industry we serve . if the average foreign exchange rate for 2001 were applied to 2002 total revenue for 2002 would have decreased by 6559000 or 9.1 and would have decreased by 1934000 or 2.9 without person . person profit a a percent of total revenue decreased to 41.0 in 2003 from 42.3 in 2002 . this decline wa caused by a change in our sale mix a well a by lower margin on gpe equipment which affected only 2003 . person profit a a percent of total revenue increased to 42.3 in 2002 from 40.1 in 2001 . the improvement wa primarily due to an improved sale mix a a result of the july 31 2001 sale of the organization heavy feeder business and to reduction in fixed cost including those made in the second half of 2001 and the elimination of goodwill expense when we adopted organization . 142 on december 30 2001 . person amortization for 2001 wa 345000 . selling general and administrative sg a expense increased by 7712000 or 35.8 in 2003 compared to 2002 . this increase wa primarily due to the acquisition of person in 2003 and employee termination cost in the organization . in addition sg a increased a a result of the adverse effect of a weaker gpe dollar when translating cost in foreign currency into gpe dollar . sg a expense decreased by 2313000 or 9.7 in 2002 compared to 2001 a decrease of approximately 425000 or 1.9 after excluding person a the loss on the sale of the organization heavy feeder business and the gain on the sale of the gpe machine and welding shop discussed above . the decrease in sg a in 2002 wa primarily due to the elimination of person a after the sale of gpe on july 31 2001 fewer employee and the benefit realized from the cost reduction implemented in the second half of 2001 but such decrease wa offset in part by the effect of higher foreign exchange rate a weaker gpe dollar . research and development r d expenditure increased by 266000 or 11.0 in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily a a result of increased tooling cost a well a the effect of a weaker gpe dollar on the translation of cost in gpe franc into gpe dollar . 20 table of organization r d expenditure decreased by 215000 or 8.1 in 2002 compared to 2001 . this decrease wa the result of lower staff cost partly due to the sale of the gpe business . the 2002 decrease wa partially offset by an increase in tooling cost and by the effect of higher foreign exchange rate a weaker gpe dollar . r d expense a a percent of total revenue wa 2.9 in 2003 3.6 in 2002 and 3.7 in 2001 . there is no significant r d expense associated with the facility and person business . interest expense increased by 1090000 or 218 in 2003 a compared to 2002 . this increase wa largely the result of adding 24000000 of acquisition debt for person in january 2003 plus to a much lesser degree foreign exchange rate a weaker gpe dollar applicable to interest paid in other currency . further information regarding the facility acquisition debt is presented in the organization and organization resources section of this item 7 . the increased interest expense wa somewhat offset by lower interest rate in 2003 on the organization debt compared with 2002 interest rate and by debt reduction of 1717000 in gpe 1486000 at the foreign exchange rate at the end of 2003 and 2904000 in the gpe . interest expense decreased by 528000 or 51.4 in 2002 versus 2001 . this decrease wa due to lower interest rate and debt reduction of 3427000 in gpe 4284000 at constant foreign exchange rate and 2754000 in the gpe which wa partially offset by higher foreign exchange rate a weaker gpe dollar . organization expense a a percent of total revenue wa 1.7 in 2003 0.7 in

before income tax improved versus 2002 primarily a a result of acquiring person and the 2002 income before income tax improved versus 2001 despite lower revenue in 2002 primarily a a result of the organization heavy feeder business sale on july 31 2001 and the benefit of the globalization and cost reduction initiative which we implemented during the latter half of 2001 . the 2003 2002 and 2001 provision for income tax of 1520000 1112000 and 231000 respectively related primarily to our higher proportion of gpe income before tax in 2003 result in the gpe and gpe in 2002 and result in the gpe and gpe in 2001 . the effective tax rate were 29.0 in 2003 25.3 in 2002 and 18.1 in 2001 . the higher effective tax rate in 2003 compared with 2002 wa primarily due to the acquisition of person and the resulting higher proportion of gpe income . the higher effective tax rate in 2002 compared with 2001 wa primarily due to an increase in foreign taxable income in 2002 a compared to 2001 which included a loss in both gpe and gpe on the sale of the gpe business . on july 1 2002 gpe approved legislation for corporation income tax reform . the change made to the law accounted for an increase in the tax provision for 2003 and 2002 of approximately 40000 and 50000 respectively after the related federal income tax benefit . we have foreign and gpe state tax loss carryforwards that total 1009000 and 7092000 respectively which if realized would have an estimated future net income benefit of approximately 320000 and 400000 respectively . we do not believe that inflation ha had a material impact on our result of operation during the last three year . our backlog at constant foreign exchange rate increased by 8131000 or 88.4 at the end of 2003 compared with yearend 2002 from
