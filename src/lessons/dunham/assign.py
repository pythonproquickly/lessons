This next step is a bit tricky. First, create an empty list called bundles. Use a loop to continue iterating as long as there are at least 5 elements left in split_prices. On each iteration, append a new ClothesBundle object to the bundles list. The ClothesBundle object will be created by making a bundle of three cheap items and two expensive items. This can be accomplished using list of items by popping from the back of split_prices three times and the popping from the front of split_prices two times. Use that list of clothes items as the bundle_items in theClothesBundle. Calculate the sum of the prices for the bundle and store that as the bundle_price in the ClothesBundle.
