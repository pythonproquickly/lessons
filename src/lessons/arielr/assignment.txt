AR
implement a simple HTTP client and server. The client will be able to GET
correctly from the web server. The test setup will be two VMs, one server and
one(or more) client. Each test will use your client, and your server. Your
client doesn’t have to support caching or recursively retrieving embedded
objects. HTTP uses TCP, you can use the textbook code as a base. Your server
must support concurrent connections: if one client is downloading a 100MB
object, another client that comes looking for a 1KB object shouldn’t have to
wait for the first to finish.
